# WikiFanBots
This is the source code I developed for developing bots in PHP to compile templates on MediaWiki projects. I developed this during my Master Degree's Project, it can be reused to extract data from the static HTML pages of the [Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology](http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/).

In the WikiFanResearchBot.php file, you can find some functions I wrote to make my bots able to dialogate with MediaWiki's APIs.
Any bot you want to develop must have a valid account on your MediaWiki project, with the bot flag and the correct rights to work. I used the BotPasswords authentication, but you can choose to use a regular account, if it has the bot flag.
